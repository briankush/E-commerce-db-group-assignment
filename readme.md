# E-commerce Database Design Project
## Overview
This project involves designing and implementing a relational database for an e-commerce platform. The database supports key functionalities such as product management, categorization, variations (e.g., size, color), and custom attributes. The project includes an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) and SQL scripts to create the database schema.
Objectives

Design an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) to model the e-commerce database.
Define entities, attributes, relationships, primary keys, foreign keys, and constraints.
Implement the database schema using SQL.
Collaborate as a team using GitHub for version control and documentation.

## Repository Structure

/diagrams: Contains the ERD (e.g., ecommerce_erd.png or ecommerce_erd.dbml).

/sql: Contains the SQL script (ecommerce.sql) to create the database schema.

README.md: This file, providing an overview and instructions.

## Database Schema
The database consists of the following tables:

- product_image: Stores product image URLs or references.
- color: Manages available color options (e.g., Red, Blue).
- product_category: Organizes products into categories (e.g., Clothing, Electronics).
- product: Stores general product details (name, brand, base price).
- product_item: Represents purchasable items with specific variations.
- brand: Stores brand information.
- product_variation: Links products to variations (e.g., size, color).
- size_category: Groups sizes into categories (e.g., Clothing Sizes, Shoe Sizes).
- size_option: Lists specific sizes (e.g., S, M, L, 42).
- product_attribute: Stores custom attributes (e.g., material, weight).
- attribute_category: Groups attributes into categories (e.g., Physical, Technical).
- attribute_type: Defines types of attributes (e.g., Text, Number).

## Relationships

One-to-Many: product to product_item, brand to product, size_category to size_option.
Many-to-One: product_image to product_item, product_variation to product_item.
Self-Referential: product_category for subcategories.

## ERD
The ERD was created using dbdiagram.io (or another tool like Lucidchart or MySQL Workbench). It visualizes entities, attributes, and relationships. Refer to /diagrams/ecommerce_erd.png for the diagram.
Setup Instructions

Clone the Repository: git clone https://github.com/briankush/E-commerce-db-group-assignment.git


## Database Setup:
Use a relational database management system (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).
Run the ecommerce.sql script in /sql to create the database and tables:mysql -u <username> -p <database-name> < sql/ecommerce.sql




View ERD:
Open /diagrams/ecommerce_erd.png or import ecommerce_erd.dbml into dbdiagram.io.



## Collaboration

Team Communication: Regular meetings via [preferred platform, e.g., Discord, Zoom].
Version Control: Use GitHub for tracking changes. Commit ERD updates, SQL scripts, and documentation.
Task Management: Assign roles (e.g., ERD designer, SQL developer, documentation lead) and track progress.

## Tools Used

ERD Design: dbdiagram.io, Lucidchart, or MySQL Workbench.
Database: MySQL (or another RDBMS).
Version Control: GitHub.
Collaboration: [e.g., Discord, Google Docs].

## Submission

The repository is public on GitHub for review.
Key deliverables:
ERD in /diagrams.
SQL schema in /sql/ecommerce.sql.
This README for documentation.
